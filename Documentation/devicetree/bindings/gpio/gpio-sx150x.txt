SEMTECH SX150x GPIO expander bindings


Required properties:

- compatible: should be "semtech,sx1506q",
			"semtech,sx1508q",
			"semtech,sx1509q",
			"semtech,sx1502q".

- reg: The I2C slave address for this device.

- interrupt-parent: phandle of the parent interrupt controller.

- interrupts: Interrupt specifier for the controllers interrupt.

- #gpio-cells: Should be 2. The first cell is the GPIO number and the
		second cell is used to specify optional parameters:
		bit 0: polarity (0: normal, 1: inverted)

- gpio-controller: Marks the device as a GPIO controller.

- interrupt-controller: Marks the device as a interrupt controller.

The GPIO expander can optionally be used as an interrupt controller, in
which case it uses the default two cell specifier as described in
Documentation/devicetree/bindings/interrupt-controller/interrupts.txt.

Optional properties:

- semtech,io-polarity: A bit-mask which enables polarity inversion for
  		       each IO line in the expander. Setting the bit
  		       at position n inverts the polarity of that IO
  		       line, while clearing it results in normal
  		       polarity. For chips with fewer than 16 IO pins,
  		       high-end bits are ignored.

- semtech,io-pullup:
- semtech,io-pulldown: A bit-mask which enables-or disables the
  		       pull-up (pull-down) resistor for each IO line
  		       in the expander. Setting the bit at position n
  		       will enable the pull-down for the IO at the
  		       corresponding offset.  For chips with fewer
  		       than 16 IO pins, high-end bits are ignored.

- semtech,reset-during-probe: Boolean, if true, the driver will
  			      trigger a full reset of the chip at the
  			      beginning of the probe in order to place
  			      it in a known state.

Example:

	i2c_gpio_expander@20{
		#gpio-cells = <2>;
		#interrupt-cells = <2>;
		compatible = "semtech,sx1506q";
		reg = <0x20>;
		interrupt-parent = <&gpio_1>;
		interrupts = <16 0>;

		gpio-controller;
		interrupt-controller;
	};
