Freescale i.MX7 System Reset Controller
======================================

Please also refer to reset.txt in this directory for common reset
controller binding usage.

Required properties:
- compatible: Should be "fsl,imx7-src", "syscon"
- reg: should be register base and length as documented in the
  datasheet
- interrupts: Should contain SRC interrupt
- #reset-cells: 1, see below

example:

src: src@30390000 {
     compatible = "fsl,imx7d-src", "syscon";
     reg = <0x30390000 0x10000>;
     interrupts = <GIC_SPI 89 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH>;
     #reset-cells = <1>;
};


Specifying reset lines connected to IP modules
==============================================

The system reset controller can be used to reset various set of
peripherals. Device nodes that need access to reset lines should
specify them as a reset phandle in their corresponding node as
specified in reset.txt.

Example:

	pcie: pcie@0x33800000 {

		...

		resets = <&src IMX7_RESET_PCIEPHY>,
			 <&src IMX7_RESET_PCIE_CTRL_APPS>;
		reset-names = "pciephy", "apps";

		...
        };
