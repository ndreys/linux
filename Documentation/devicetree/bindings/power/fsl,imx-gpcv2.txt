Freescale i.MX General Power Controller v2
==========================================

The i.MX7S/D General Power Control (GPC) block contains Power Gating
Control (PGC) for various power domains.

Required properties:

- compatible: Should be "fsl,imx7d-gpc"

- reg: should be register base and length as documented in the
  datasheet

- interrupts: Should contain GPC interrupt request 1

- pcie-phy-supply: Link to the LDO regulator powering the PCIE PHY
  power domain (connected to PCIE_VP/VP_TX/VP_RX pads)

- mipi-phy-supply: Link to the LDO regulator powering the MIPI PHY
  power domain (connected to VDD_MIPI_1P0 pad)

- usb-hsic-phy-supply: Link to the LDO regulator powering the USB HSIC
  PHY power domain (connected to VDD_USB_H_1P2 pad)

- #power-domain-cells: Should be 1, see below:

The gpc node is a power-controller as documented by the generic power
domain bindings in
Documentation/devicetree/bindings/power/power_domain.txt.

Example:

	gpc: gpc@303a0000 {
		compatible = "fsl,imx7d-gpc";
		reg = <0x303a0000 0x10000>;
		interrupt-controller;
		interrupts = <GIC_SPI 87 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH>;
		#interrupt-cells = <3>;
		interrupt-parent = <&intc>;
		#power-domain-cells = <1>;
		pcie-phy-supply = <&reg_1p0d>;
	};


Specifying power domain for IP modules
======================================

IP cores belonging to a power domain should contain a 'power-domains'
property that is a phandle pointing to the gpc device node and a
DOMAIN_INDEX specifying the power domain the device belongs to.

Example of a device that is part of the PU power domain:

	pcie: pcie@0x33800000 {
	      reg = <0x33800000 0x4000>,
	            <0x4ff00000 0x80000>;
		/* ... */
		power-domains = <&gpc IMX7_POWER_DOMAIN_PCIE_PHY>;
		/* ... */
	};

All valid DOMAIN_INDEX values are defined and can be found in
include/dt-bindings/power/imx7-power.h
